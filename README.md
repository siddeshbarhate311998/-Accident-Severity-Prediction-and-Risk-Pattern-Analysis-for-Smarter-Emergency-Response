# 🚗 Accident Severity Prediction and Risk Pattern Analysis for Smarter Emergency Response

## 📌 Project Overview
Accident severity is often hard to assess in real time, delaying emergency response and decision-making. This project analyzes US traffic accident data (1.5 million records) to identify accident risk patterns and predict severity levels based on key factors.

The goal is to help emergency services prioritize responses and support data-driven road safety planning.



## 🛠️ Problem Statement
Emergency teams often lack early insights into how severe an accident might be. Without this information, resource allocation becomes challenging, which can impact the effectiveness of emergency response and safety strategies.



## 💡 Solution Approach
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover accident patterns by day, time, and conditions.
- Identified that **most accidents occur on Fridays, between 4 PM and 7 PM**, under poor weather, low visibility, and bad road conditions.
- Built a **Random Forest classification model** to predict accident severity using:
  - Weather condition  
  - Visibility  
  - Road quality  
- Achieved approximately **80% accuracy** in predicting accident severity.


## 🎯 Impact
- Enables **faster prioritization of critical incidents** for emergency teams.
- Supports **policy decisions** and **insurance risk assessment** with data-backed insights.
- Contributes to **smarter road safety planning** and resource optimization.


## 📂 Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (EDA and Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning, Random Forest)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**


## 📊 Key Features
✔️ Accident trend analysis by day, time, and conditions  
✔️ Predictive model for accident severity classification  
✔️ Clean and well-documented notebook with visualizations and insights
